       <p>Edward Huber was the man who invented the steam engine. He was a man of great vision. He could visualize how steam might displace the power of horses. His vision was realized through the development of the “The New Huber,” a steam powered engine built in 1878. The steam engine was very important as it could help people to travel faster instead of depending on horses to help them travel. The steam engine changed the world as many wanted it which it would be made into cars and trains. The steam engine helps the transport to move when you make it to move on its controls. It is a bit important as it help people to transport or travel as it would be much easier.

<p> In the past, people had to use horses to transport them. Then, many years later, steam engine was invented and many people used them to make new transports like trains, cars and ships.</p>
<p> After WW1 ended, countries like the US, USSR, Germany, Japan, China, Poland, Britian, France and many other countries build more tanks, aircraft and warships to provide defence just in case there is another war or for their empire to take over the world. There is a important resource that they need which is steam engines to help their tanks, aircraft and warships to move in battle.</p>
